Questionable Projects (Are they worth the time?):
1. Dice Roller Application.
2. Tic-Tac-Toe Application.

Goals to One Day Complete (Probably completed under the Sabb Entertainment banner):
1. This Mars RPG game. Set in the future, has three or four cities, and a bunch of settlements. Lotta side quests, cool story. Plays like Witcher 3 or Assassins Creed: Origins.
2. This Ninja MMO. Naruto, but with friends!
3. Criminal Underworld. A better version of Grand Theft Auto. Actual, more akin to the Mafia games than GTA.
4. The Phantom. Mix of Batman Arkham Knight, Insomniac's Spider-Man, and the Watch Dogs games. Sounds fun!
5. This epic Space-Detective game. It'll be amazing. It'll be like Star Wars, but even more awesome.
6. War of the Five Kings, a medieval RPG game with multiplayer capablities. Akin to Game of Thrones and Skyrim or Witcher.
7. Something similar to the Monster Hunter games and the Witcher series. But cooler. Can't do any better than Witcher 3 unfortunately, that game is perfect.
8. A WWIII FPS. Kinda like Crisis 3. Why not?
9. An action-adventure RPG game akin to the first Watch Dogs. But, this time, the main character won't be a boring and unlikable character! Regardless of how badass Aiden was.

Questions to Answer:
1. A person on Reddit said "Make a RESTful API." What did s/he mean by this?

After all this, I'm sure I'll have more experience in Python and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (The Web Triumvirate as I call them) for Front-End development, so I'll move onto C then C++ and Java and finally onto C#. Then whatever after that.
